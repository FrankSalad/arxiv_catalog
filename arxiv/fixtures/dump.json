Although language workbenches have\nsimplified the design of DSLs and extensions to general purpose languages,\nstatic analyses must still be implemented manually.\n  Inquiry: Moreover, static analyses, e.g., complexity metrics, dependency\nanalysis, and declaration-use analysis, are usually domain-dependent and cannot\nbe easily reused. Therefore, transferring existing static analyses to another\nDSL incurs a huge implementation overhead. However, this overhead is not always\nintrinsically necessary: in many cases, while the concepts of the DSL on which\na static analysis is performed are domain-specific, the underlying algorithm\nemployed in the analysis is actually domain-independent and thus can be reused\nin principle, depending on how it is specified. While current approaches either\nimplement static analyses internally or with an external Visitor, the\nimplementation is tied to the language's grammar and cannot be reused easily.\nThus far, a commonly used approach that achieves reusable static analysis\nrelies on the transformation into an intermediate representation upon which the\nanalysis is performed. This, however, entails a considerable additional\nimplementation effort.\n  Approach: To remedy this, it has been proposed to map the necessary\ndomain-specific concepts to the algorithm's domain-independent data structures,\nyet without a practical implementation and the demonstration of reuse. Thus, to\nmake static analysis reusable again, we employ relational Reference Attribute\nGrammars (RAGs) by creating such a mapping to a domain-independent overlay\nstructure using higher-order attributes.\n  Knowledge: We describe how static analysis can be specified on\nanalysis-specific data structures, how relational RAGs can help with the\nspecification, and how a mapping from the domain-specific language can be\nperformed. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a static analysis for a DSL can be\nexternalized and reused in another general purpose language.\n  Grounding: The approach was evaluated using the RAG system JastAdd. To\nillustrate reusability, we implemented two analyses with two addressed\nlanguages each: a cycle detection analysis used in a small state machine DSL\nand for detecting circular dependencies in Java types and packages, and an\nanalysis of variable shadowing, applied to both Java and the Modelica modelling\nlanguage. Thereby, we demonstrate the reuse of two analysis algorithms in three\ncompletely different domains. Additionally, we use the cycle detection analysis\nto evaluate the efficiency by comparing our external analysis to an internal\nreference implementation analysing all Java programs in the Qualitas Corpus and\nthereby are able to show that an externalized analysis incurs only minimal\noverhead.\n  Importance: We make static analysis reusable, again, showing the practicality\nand efficiency of externalizing static analysis for both DSLs and general\npurpose languages using relational RAGs.\n", "published": "2020-02-14T18:58:55Z", "updated": "2020-02-14T18:58:55Z"}}, {"model": "arxiv.article", "pk": 3, "fields": {"article_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06185v1", "title": "Robust Contract Evolution in a TypeSafe MicroServices Architecture", "subject": "", "summary": "  Microservices architectures allow for short deployment cycles and immediate\neffects but offer no safety mechanisms when service contracts need to be\nchanged.

A\nDomain-Specific Language (DSL) is an artificial software language tailored for\na particular application domain. Usually, DSL users are domain experts that may\nnot have a software engineering background. As a consequence, they might not be\nfamiliar with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Thus, the development\nof tools that offer different interfaces for interacting with a DSL is\nrelevant.\n  Inquiry: However, resources available to DSL designers are limited. We would\nlike to leverage tools used to interact with general purpose languages in the\ncontext of DSLs. Computational notebooks are an example of such tools. Then,\nour main question is: What is an efficient and effective method of designing\nand implementing notebook interfaces for DSLs? By addressing this question we\nmight be able to speed up the development of DSL tools, and ease the\ninteraction between end-users and DSLs.\n  Approach: In this paper, we present Bacat\\'a, a mechanism for generating\nnotebook interfaces for DSLs in a language parametric fashion. We designed this\nmechanism in a way in which language engineers can reuse as many language\ncomponents (e.g., language processors, type checkers, code generators) as\npossible.\n  Knowledge: Our results show that notebook interfaces generated by Bacat\\'a\ncan be automatically generated with little manual configuration. There are few\nconsiderations and caveats that should be addressed by language engineers that\nrely on language design aspects. The creation of a notebook for a DSL with\nBacat\\'a becomes a matter of writing the code that wires existing language\ncomponents in the Rascal language workbench with the Jupyter platform.\n  Grounding: We evaluate Bacat\\'a by generating functional computational\nnotebook interfaces for three different non-trivial DSLs, namely: a small\nsubset of Halide (a DSL for digital image processing), SweeterJS (an extended\nversion of JavaScript), and QL (a DSL for questionnaires). Additionally, it is\nrelevant to generate notebook implementations rather than implementing them\nmanually. We measured and compared the number of Source Lines of Code (SLOCs)\nthat we reused from existing implementations of those languages.\n  Importance: The adoption of notebooks by novice-programmers and end-users has\nmade them very popular in several domains such as exploratory programming, data\nscience, data journalism, and machine learning. Why are they popular? In (data)\nscience, it is essential to make results reproducible as well as\nunderstandable. However, notebooks are only available for GPLs. This paper\nopens up the notebook metaphor for DSLs to improve the end-user experience when\ninteracting with code and to increase DSLs adoption.\n", "published": "2020-02-14T18:56:41Z", "updated": "2020-02-14T18:56:41Z"}}, {"model": "arxiv.article", "pk": 6, "fields": {"article_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06176v1", "title": "Functional Programming in Pattern-Match-Oriented Programming Style", "subject": "", "summary": "  Throughout the history of functional programming, recursion has emerged as a\nnatural method for describing loops in programs. However, there does often\nexist a substantial cognitive distance between the recursive definition and the\nsimplest explanation of an algorithm even for the basic list processing\nfunctions such as map, concat, or unique; when we explain these functions, we\nseldom use recursion explicitly as we do in functional programming. For\nexample, map is often explained as follows: the map function takes a function\nand a list and returns a list of the results of applying the function to all\nthe elements of the list.\n  This paper advocates a new programming paradigm called pattern-match-oriented\nprogramming for filling this gap. An essential ingredient of our method is\nutilizing pattern matching for non-free data types. Pattern matching for\nnon-free data types features non-linear pattern matching with backtracking and\nextensibility of pattern-matching algorithms. Several non-standard pattern\nconstructs, such as not-patterns, loop patterns, and sequential patterns, are\nderived from this pattern-matching facility. Based on that result, this paper\nintroduces many programming techniques that replace explicit recursions with an\nintuitive pattern by confining recursions inside patterns. We classify these\ntechniques as pattern-match-oriented programming design patterns.\n  These programming techniques allow us to redefine not only the most basic\nfunctions for list processing such as map, concat, or unique more elegantly\nthan the traditional functional programming style, but also more practical\nmathematical algorithms and software such as a SAT solver, computer algebra\nsystem, and database query language that we had not been able to implement\nconcisely.\n", "published": "2020-02-14T18:55:54Z", "updated": "2020-02-14T18:55:54Z"}}, {"model": "arxiv.article", "pk": 7, "fields": {"article_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06175v1", "title": "Improving accuracy of the fifth-order WENO scheme by using the\n  exponential approximation space", "subject": "", "summary": "  The aim of this study is to develop a novel WENO scheme that improves the\nperformance of the well-known fifth-order WENO methods.

Traditional algorithms for\ncomputing rank revealing factorizations, such as the column pivoted QR\nfactorization, or techniques for computing a full singular value decomposition\nof a matrix, are very communication intensive. They are naturally expressed as\na sequence of matrix-vector operations, which become prohibitively expensive\nwhen data is not available in main memory. Randomization allows these methods\nto be reformulated so that large contiguous blocks of the matrix can be\nprocessed in bulk. The paper describes two distinct methods. The first is a\nblocked version of column pivoted Householder QR, organized as a\n``left-looking'' method to minimize the number of write operations (which are\nmore expensive than read operations on a spinning disk drive). The second\nmethod results in a so called UTV factorization which expresses a matrix $A$ as\n$A = U T V^*$ where $U$ and $V$ are unitary, and $T$ is triangular. This method\nis organized as an algorithm-by-blocks, in which floating point operations\noverlap read and write operations. The second method incorporates power\niterations, and is exceptionally good at revealing the numerical rank; it can\noften be used as a substitute for a full singular value decomposition.\nNumerical experiments demonstrate that the new algorithms are almost as fast\nwhen processing data stored on a hard drive as traditional algorithms are for\ndata stored in main memory.

Moreover, the simplest and most\npopular algorithm for $k$-means, namely Lloyd's algorithm, generally converges\nto such spurious local solutions both in theory and in practice.\n  In this paper, we approach the $k$-means problem from a new perspective, by\ninvestigating the structures of these spurious local solutions under a\nprobabilistic generative model with $k$ ground truth clusters. As soon as\n$k=3$, spurious local minima provably exist, even for well-separated and\nbalanced clusters. One such local minimum puts two centers at one true cluster,\nand the third center in the middle of the other two true clusters. For general\n$k$, one local minimum puts multiple centers at a true cluster, and one center\nin the middle of multiple true clusters. Perhaps surprisingly, we prove that\nthis is essentially the only type of spurious local minima under a separation\ncondition. Our results pertain to the $k$-means formulation for mixtures of\nGaussians or bounded distributions. Our theoretical results corroborate\nexisting empirical observations and provide justification for several improved\nalgorithms for $k$-means clustering.\n", "published": "2020-02-16T22:15:03Z", "updated": "2020-02-16T22:15:03Z"}}, {"model": "arxiv.article", "pk": 179, "fields": {"article_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06693v1", "title": "Bringing high spatial resolution to the Far-infrared -- A giant leap for\n  astrophysics", "subject": "astro-ph.IM", "summary": "  The far-infrared (FIR) regime is one of the few wavelength ranges where no\nastronomical data with sub-arcsecond spatial resolution exist.

It is built from two components, one\nrepresenting the radially anisotropic Sausage stars with their lobed velocity\ndistribution, the other representing a more metal-poor and more isotropic\ncomponent built up from minor mergers. We show that inside 25 kpc the \"Sausage\"\ncontributes at least 50 % of the Galactic halo. The fraction of \"Sausage\" stars\ndiminishes sharply beyond 30 kpc, which is the long-established break radius of\nthe classical stellar halo.\n", "published": "2018-07-11T18:00:04Z", "updated": "2020-02-14T19:18:47Z"}}, {"model": "arxiv.article", "pk": 378, "fields": {"article_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06218v1", "title": "The Life Cycle of the Central Molecular Zone.

Feedback is most valuable when it happens immediately,\nas defects can be corrected instantly before they become harder to fix.

While there\nare numerous static approaches that output a ranking of tests solely based on\nthe current version of a program, we focus on change-based test prioritization,\nwhich recommends tests that likely fail in response to the most recent program\nchange. The canonical approach relies on coverage data and prioritizes tests\nthat cover the changed region, but obtaining and updating coverage data is\ncostly. More recently, information retrieval techniques that exploit\noverlapping vocabulary between change and tests have proven to be powerful, yet\nlightweight.\n  In this work, we demonstrate the capabilities of information retrieval for\nprioritizing tests in dynamic programming languages using Python as example. We\ndiscuss and measure previously understudied variation points, including how\ncontextual information around a program change can be used, and design\nalternatives to the widespread \\emph{TF-IDF} retrieval model tailored to\nretrieving failing tests.\n  To obtain program changes with associated test failures, we designed a tool\nthat generates a large set of faulty changes from version history along with\ntheir test results.

We then\nexplore and compare two approaches that might be used to estimate these\nparameters: Machine Learning and the established $\\Delta$-Variance procedure.\nWe show that for $2\\leq\\beta \\leq 4$ and $0\\leq{\\cal S}\\leq 3$, a suitably\ntrained Convolutional Neural Network is able to estimate objectively both\n$\\beta$ (with root-mean-square error $\\epsilon_{_\\beta}\\sim 0.12$) and ${\\cal\nS}$ (with $\\epsilon_{_{\\cal S}}\\sim 0.29$). $\\;\\Delta$-variance is also able to\nestimate $\\beta$, albeit with a somewhat larger error ($\\epsilon_{_\\beta}\\sim\n0.17$) and with some human intervention, but is not able to estimate ${\\cal\nS}$.\n", "published": "2020-02-13T14:12:18Z", "updated": "2020-02-13T14:12:18Z"}}, {"model": "arxiv.article", "pk": 654, "fields": {"article_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.13037v2", "title": "Algebraic analysis of multiple social networks with multiplex", "subject": "cs.SI", "summary": "  \\pkg{multiplex} is a computer program that provides algebraic tools for the\nanalysis of multiple network structures within the \\proglang{R} environment.\nApart from the possibility to create and manipulate multivariate data\nrepresenting multiplex, signed, and two-mode networks, this package offers a\ncollection of functions that deal with algebraic systems ---such as the\npartially ordered semigroup, and balance or cluster semirings--- their\ndecomposition, and the enumeration of bundle patterns occurring at different\nlevels of the network.
