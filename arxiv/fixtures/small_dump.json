To address\nthe issue, we propose a smoothed approximation, namely the SOFT (Scalable\nOptimal transport-based diFferenTiable) top-k operator.

This challenge gets\nexacerbated with new layer types (e.g., depth-wise and point-wise convolutions)\nand diverse hardware accelerator configurations. To address this challenge, we\npropose a decoupled off-chip/on-chip approach that decomposes the mapping space\ninto off-chip and on-chip subspaces, and first optimizes the off-chip subspace\nfollowed by the on-chip subspace. The motivation for this decomposition is to\ndramatically reduce the size of the search space, and to also prioritize the\noptimization of off-chip data movement, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude more\ncompared to the on-chip data movement. We introduce {\\em Marvel}, which\nimplements the above approach by leveraging two cost models to explore the two\nsubspaces -- a classical distinct-block (DB) locality cost model for the\noff-chip subspace, and a state-of-the-art DNN accelerator behavioral cost\nmodel, MAESTRO, for the on-chip subspace. Our approach also considers dimension\npermutation, a form of data-layouts, in the mapping space formulation along\nwith the loop transformations.\n", "published": "2020-02-18T17:39:21Z", "updated": "2020-02-18T17:39:21Z"}}, {"model": "arxiv.article", "pk": 22, "fields": {"article_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07747v1", "title": "Mapping the Interplanetary Filesystem", "subject": "cs.NI", "summary": "  The Interplanetary Filesystem (IPFS) is a distributed data storage service\nfrequently used by blockchain applications and for sharing content in a\ncensorship-resistant manner.

By ``hopping'' iteratively to such larger cycles, we obtain a\npowerful and very general inductive motor for proving and computing long cycles\n(we will give an algorithm with running time $O(n^2)$). This provides a method\nto prove lower bounds on Tutte cycles, as $C'$ will be a Tutte cycle of $G$ if\n$C$ is.

Leveraging on recent studies on the neural connectome\nassociated with eye movements, we designed a neuromorphic oculomotor controller\nand placed it at the heart of our in-house biomimetic robotic head prototype.\nThe controller is unique in the sense that (1) all data are encoded and\nprocessed by a spiking neural network (SNN), and (2) by mimicking the\nassociated brain areas' connectivity, the SNN required no training to operate.\nA biologically-constrained Hebbian learning further improved the SNN\nperformance in tracking a moving target. Here, we report the tracking\nperformance of the robotic head and show that the robotic eye kinematics are\nsimilar to those reported in human eye studies. This work contributes to our\nongoing effort to develop energy-efficient neuromorphic SNN and harness their\nemerging intelligence to control biomimetic robots with versatility and\nrobustness.\n", "published": "2020-02-18T13:03:06Z", "updated": "2020-02-18T13:03:06Z"}}, {"model": "arxiv.article", "pk": 102, "fields": {"article_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07528v1", "title": "A Computationally Efficient Neural Network Invariant to the Action of\n  Symmetry Subgroups", "subject": "cs.LG", "summary": "  We introduce a method to design a computationally efficient $G$-invariant\nneural network that approximates functions invariant to the action of a given\npermutation subgroup $G \\leq S_n$ of the symmetric group on input data.

The Virgo detector was also taking\ndata that did not contribute to detection due to a low signal-to-noise ratio,\nbut were used for subsequent parameter estimation. The 90% credible intervals\nfor the component masses range from 1.12 to 2.52 $M_{\\odot}$ (1.45 to 1.88\n$M_{\\odot}$ if we restrict the dimensionless component spin magnitudes to be\nsmaller than 0.05). These mass parameters are consistent with the individual\nbinary components being neutron stars. However, both the source-frame chirp\nmass $1.44^{+0.02}_{-0.02} M_{\\odot}$ and the total mass\n$3.4^{+0.3}_{-0.1}\\,M_{\\odot}$ of this system are significantly larger than\nthose of any other known binary neutron star system. The possibility that one\nor both binary components of the system are black holes cannot be ruled out\nfrom gravitational-wave data. We discuss possible origins of the system based\non its inconsistency with the known Galactic binary neutron star population.\nUnder the assumption that the signal was produced by a binary neutron star\ncoalescence, the local rate of neutron star mergers is updated to $250-2810\n\\text{Gpc}^{-3}\\text{yr}^{-1}$.\n", "published": "2020-01-06T19:54:55Z", "updated": "2020-02-17T22:43:27Z"}}, {"model": "arxiv.author", "pk": 1, "fields": {"name": "Tiago P.
